FlowV1

This is a proof of concept application for a tech news aggregator website which scrapes data from a variety of
sources. This is a Ruby-on-Rails app with a Bootstrap front-end. This application is currently in its V1 stage
and is a work in progress. I was inspired to write this app after I wanted a way to aggregate all the news sources
I frequented / articles that I encountered. Using multiple browsers, I would lose track of my bookmarks and subsequently
spend time looking for these sources. FlowV1 allows me to favourite these sources and come back to find them at a later
time.

Ruby Version: ruby-2.2.2

How to Run App:

1. Download
2. cd into directory
3. Run 'bundle install'
4. Run 'rake db:migrate'
Optional: Run 'rake db:seed', username: user1 & password: 1234, will be generated.
5. Run 'rails s'
6. Visit 'http://localhost:3000/' in your browser

Enjoy!
